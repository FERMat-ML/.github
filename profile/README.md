**FERMat: Foundational Representation of Materials**
<br><br>
The FERMat project aims to establish a new technological paradigm and the software infrastructure necessary for the development of 
machine learning models capable of predicting the properties of unseen molecular and materials systems and structures, thus accelerating 
the computational discovery of new molecules and materials.
